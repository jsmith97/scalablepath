I'm Ben, a technologist with over 20 years of experience building and scaling systems, teams and functions across the public and private sector.

I’ve worked hands on across infrastructure, cloud, networking and security, starting as a support analyst and growing into architecture, consulting and engineering leadership roles. I've delivered in high pressure, large scale environments including financial services, government and now product.

Today, I lead the technology team at PortSwigger, covering platform engineering, security, tech ops and user success. My focus is on building resilient systems, enabling high-trust teams and aligning technology with real-world outcomes.

I’ve previously led DevSecOps at Barclays, consulted at ThoughtWorks, and held architecture leadership roles across DWP, Co-op Bank and more. From early career network engineering to shaping organisational strategy, I’ve always cared about delivery, clarity and building technology that actually matters.

This site is where I write about AI, engineering leadership, systems thinking and the constant evolution of technology and teams.
