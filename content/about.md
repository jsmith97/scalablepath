I’m Ben, a technologist with 20+ years of experience building systems, teams and capabilities across infrastructure, security and cloud. I’ve delivered in high-pressure environments such as finance, government and product, and grown from hands-on support into architecture, consulting and engineering leadership.

Right now, I lead the technology function at PortSwigger, covering platform engineering, security, tech ops and user success. I care about resilient systems, high-trust teams and aligning technology with real-world outcomes.

Before this, I led DevSecOps at Barclays, consulted at ThoughtWorks, and held architecture roles at DWP, Co-op Bank and others. From early network engineering to org-wide strategy, I’ve always focused on delivery, clarity and making tech that actually matters.

This site is where I share thoughts on AI, engineering leadership, systems thinking and how teams and technology evolve together.
